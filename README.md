# Super Sweat

Super Sweat is a sleek, Django‑powered web app designed for gaming communities to effortlessly build and manage guilds. Members can join or leave guilds, take on custom roles (Leader, Officer, Member, etc.), and RSVP to scheduled events—all through an intuitive interface. Profile avatars, external account linking, and reusable event templates keep everything organized and tailored to your group’s needs.
